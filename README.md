# SpaceGameDev's Website     [![Better Uptime Badge](https://betteruptime.com/status-badges/v1/monitor/o4k1.svg)](https://betteruptime.com/?utm_source=status_badge)
This website serves as a portfolio for my projects. It is also a personal project that I've been working on as a challenge to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I intentionally avoided using a website builder as I wanted to make the entire thing from scratch.

I have a Trello board for tracking progress on new features, available here: https://trello.com/b/rL6rAoZv

The website is deployed with Cloudflare Pages at https://spacegamedev.com
