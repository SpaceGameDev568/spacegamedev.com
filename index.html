        <br><br>
        <p class="about-me-bio">
            I started learning software development back in 2021 when I was curious about how the games that I enjoyed
            were made. This lead me to download <u><a class="standard-link" href="https://unity.com">Unity</a></u> and
            begin following the courses on their website to learn game development. I gained a lot of knowledge about
            the game design process and the basics of programming from the time I spent in Unity. After that, I took
            what I had learned and decided to try to make some mods for a game I play, called <u><a
                class="standard-link" href="https://satisfactorygame.com">Satisfactory</a></u>. This led me to create several
            mods, which I published on <u><a class="standard-link" href="https://ficsit.app/user/5GqLMHyzA3myPG">ficsit.app</a></u>
            and <u><a class="standard-link" href="https://github.com/SpaceGameDev568?tab=repositories">GitHub</a></u>.
            If you would like, you can read more about them on the <u><a class="standard-link" href="projects.html">projects
            page</a></u>.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="about-me-bio">When <u><a class="standard-link" href="https://unrealengine.com">Unreal Engine 5</a></u>
            launched in April 2022, I chose to focus my efforts for a while on learning how to use it to get some
            experience using industry standard software. In late 2022, I began working on a website for myself to show
            off my skills and to attain some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also gained some familiarity with
            <u><a class="standard-link" href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a></u> and <u><a class="standard-link"
                                                                                         href="https://perforce.com">Perforce</a></u>
            for version control of these projects. In 2023, I was beginning learn programming with the <u><a
                    class="standard-link" href="https://go.dev">Go language</a></u> to create a <u><a
                    class="standard-link" href="https://github.com/SpaceGameDev568/Charles">command line application</a></u>
            to automate some basic computing tasks and to make it easier for me to debug issues with other apps. This app was ultimately never completed as I lost interest in the project.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="about-me-bio">More recently I've taken interest in the IT industry and I'm looking to get a career in tech when I graduate high school.
            I've been teaching myself network administration and automation in my free time. In October 2023 I completed the Google IT Support
            Specialist Certificate course in order to prepare myself for an entry-level job in the industry. You can see all the certificates I've earned on the <u><a class="standard-link" href="certifications.html">Certifications</a></u> page or on my <u><a class="standard-link" href="linkedin.html">LinkedIn</a></u> profile.</p>
